# **hotfloppy: Who am I?**

Hello!

People knows me as hotfloppy and some know me as 'Pencinta Kucing' too which is a nickname I've used to use on FB.

I'm currently working as Linux System Administrator as my daily job and a fulltime father and a husband.

# My Journey (Linux)

Nothing really interesting about me actually. Hurm..

My journey with Linux started with Knoppix back in 2003.

Back then, I merely use Knoppix as a utility to backup my data from Windows partition whenever I messed it up.

When Ubuntu was released in 2004, I was so excited and ordered for their free CD (yes, they delivers free CD back then) and start distributed it among friends.

# My Journey (Linux)

I started dual booting my PC and play around. Lots of misconfiguration, corrupted filesystem and hundreds of hours spent to fix all of them.

Back then, I don't have internet connection at home. So any troubleshooting will requires me to travel to nearby cybercafe, search for possible solutions and run back home to test it out. Successfully fixed? Good. Failed? Repeat. **sweat**

# My Journey (Gamehacking)

Back in 2004 too, I was quite active in creating a game trainer with few friends. (I'm not sure if there's any local gamehacking scene in Malaysia back then.)
Super Collapse II, C&C Generals, Zoo Tycoons etc, just to name a few gametrainers that I released back then. There's few tutorials released too.
Tools used for said activies: T-Search, OllyDbg, Win32DASM, Game Trainer Studio etc.

I did have a tutorial for keygen (already gone, couldn't find it anywhere) and a patcher too. But no crack or patch released.

Nowadays I use mostly Linux, 99.9% of the time, so all those are behind me now. But good memories remains.
